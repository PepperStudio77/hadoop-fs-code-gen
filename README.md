# hadoop-fs-code-gen

This repo explore multiple way to generate a code which implement a customised hadoop Filesystem for spark. 
The gaol is to find the best way to do AI-driven development with high specification and high quality. 


## Fly Mode
Only Provide AI with the descriptions of the problem. Letting AI to design the architecture as well as the code. 



## Leap Mode
Given your architecture descriptions, generate code without explicitly split the task to stages. 
when you describe your architecture in word term without explicitly breakdown your code generations to steps.
